  	-***default***: This theme is defined within the component and will be applied if no other theme is selected.
  	-***light***: This theme is defined outside of the component. This theme will provide brighter colors, compared to the default theme.
  	-***dark***: This theme is defined outside of the component. This theme will provide darker colors, compared to the default theme.
